# About Chippy
Chippy is a set of basic chip-tune like sounds for use in Tox clients. (Think Nintendo Entertainment System or Sega Genesis sounds)

It is ment to be a tollerable yet still slightly annoying to the user to get their attention.

All sounds were made using Garageband on Mac OSX but are original composition using software instruments.

You are free to use and edit these in Tox Clients as you wish, but remember that they where made with certain useages in mind.
