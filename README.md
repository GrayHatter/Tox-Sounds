Introduction
============

This repository hosts a collection of sounds that Tox client developers may
pick up and use freely in their software.

Contributing
============

At the top level, the repository is organized by the name of the "sound pack",
or whatever it is that you'd like to call your collection of sounds.

Underneath the top level, the repository is organized into categories of
sounds. The categories are:

* Call Sounds
* Error Sounds
* Misc
* Notification Sounds

Each category belongs in its own folder.

To contribute, just submit a pull request containing your sounds in a lossless
format. Your work must be released under a **free** license in order to be
included in this repository, and this license must be included in the top level
of your respective sound collections.

Thanks, and happy sound...ing... or something...
